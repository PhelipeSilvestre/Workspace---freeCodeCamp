          Avenged Sevenfold (abbreviated as A7X) is an American heavy metal band
          from Huntington Beach, California, formed in 1999. The band's current
          lineup consists of vocalist M. Shadows, rhythm guitarist Zacky
          Vengeance, lead guitarist Synyster Gates, bassist Johnny Christ, and
          drummer Brooks Wackerman. Avenged Sevenfold are known for their
          diverse rock sound and dramatic imagery in album covers and
          merchandise.[1] The band emerged with a metalcore sound on their debut
          album Sounding the Seventh Trumpet and largely continued this sound
          through their second album Waking the Fallen. The band's style had
          evolved by their third album and first major label release, City of
          Evil, into a more traditional heavy metal style. The band continued to
          explore new sounds with its self-titled release and enjoyed continued
          mainstream success before their founding drummer, Jimmy "The Rev"
          Sullivan, died in 2009. Despite his death, Avenged Sevenfold continued
          on with the help of ex-Dream Theater member Mike Portnoy, and released
          and toured in support of their fifth album Nightmare in 2010, which
          debuted atop the Billboard 200, their first number one debut.[2] In
          2011, drummer Arin Ilejay joined the band on tours and recording. The
          band's sixth studio album Hail to the King, which was released in
          2013, marked the only Avenged Sevenfold album featuring Ilejay. It
          would feature a heavy metal and hard rock style, with it being written
          as a tribute to their influences. Hail to the King charted as number 1
          on the Billboard 200, the UK Albums chart, as well as the Finnish,
          Brazilian, Canadian, and Irish charts. Ilejay left the band in late
          2014 and was replaced by former Bad Religion drummer Brooks Wackerman,
          but the lineup change was not announced to the public until 2015. The
          band then surprise-released their seventh studio album The Stage in
          October 2016, which debuted as number 4 on the Billboard 200 chart in
          the US. The Stage is their first conceptual album and marked another
          stylistic change for the band, moving towards a progressive metal
          sound. The band released their eighth studio album, Life Is But a
          Dream..., a highly experimental record, in June 2023. To date, Avenged
          Sevenfold have released eight studio albums, one live album/DVD, two
          compilation albums and eighteen singles and have sold over 8 million
          albums worldwide,[3] and their records have received numerous
          certification awards, including five platinum album awards from their
          home country's institution (RIAA). They have also created four
          original songs for the Call of Duty: Black Ops series, all of which
          were compiled together in the 2018 EP Black Reign. The band were
          ranked No. 47 on Loudwire's list of Top 50 Metal Bands of All Time.[4]
